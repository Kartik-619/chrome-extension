# chrome-extension
 A lightweight Chrome extension to toggle dark mode on any website and block distracting domains. Built using Manifest V3, with dynamic rule control and a simple popup UI.
<h1> Personal Chrome Extension â€” Dark Mode & Site Blocker ðŸš€</h1>
A lightweight and beginner-friendly Chrome Extension that allows users to:
- ðŸŒ“ Toggle dark mode on any website
- ðŸš« Block distracting domains (e.g. Facebook, YouTube)
Built from scratch using Manifest V3 and native Chrome Extension APIs, this project taught me how to build a real browser tool that interacts with tabs, scripts, and declarative rules.

<h2><b>ðŸ’¡ What I Learned</b></h2>
This project started with curiosity and ended with confidence. Hereâ€™s what I explored and implemented:
- Setting up a valid manifest.json using Manifest V3
- Communicating between popup UI and service workers using chrome.runtime.sendMessage
- Using chrome.scripting.executeScript to inject custom styling into active tabs
- Blocking specific URLs with chrome.declarativeNetRequest (static and dynamic rules)
- Handling edge cases: restricted chrome:// URLs, serialization errors, and background script persistence
- Designing a clean popup with HTML/CSS/JS<br>
