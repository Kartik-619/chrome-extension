<h1> Personal Chrome Extension â€” Dark Mode & Site Blocker ðŸš€</h1><br>
A lightweight and beginner-friendly Chrome Extension that allows users to:
<li>- ðŸŒ“ Toggle dark mode on any website</li>
<li>- ðŸš« Block distracting domains (e.g. Facebook, YouTube)</li><br>
Built from scratch using Manifest V3 and native Chrome Extension APIs, this project taught me how to build a real browser tool that interacts with tabs, scripts, and declarative rules.

<h2><b>ðŸ’¡ What I Learned</b></h2><br>
This project started with curiosity and ended with confidence. Hereâ€™s what I explored and implemented:
<br>
<br>- Setting up a valid manifest.json using Manifest V3
<br>- Communicating between popup UI and service workers using chrome.runtime.sendMessage
<br>- Using chrome.scripting.executeScript to inject custom styling into active tabs
<br>- Blocking specific URLs with chrome.declarativeNetRequest (static and dynamic rules)
<br>- Handling edge cases: restricted chrome:// URLs, serialization errors, and background script persistence
<br>- Designing a clean popup with HTML/CSS/JS<br>
